### ⚠️ THIS ADDON [IS STILL IN ALPHA](https://github.com/bitbrain/pandora/milestone/1) AND NOT PRODUCTION-READY YET.

**Meet _Pandora_, an addon for the Godot Engine that simplifies the handling of RPG data.** Pandora allows you to easily manage RPG elements like items, spells, abilities, characters, monsters, and loot tables. Whether you're building a traditional turn-based RPG or a fast-paced action game, this addon can help.

# Features

### 📚 Centralized data management

Manage all your RPG data in one place. Create, edit, and delete items, spells, abilities, characters, monsters, and loot tables easily. Access all data directly in the code via the `Pandora` API.

### 🔧 Customizable and Modular

Adjust Pandora to fit your game's needs. By default, data is stored in .json files, but you can implement your own data backend.

### 🧪 Tested

To keep the codebase clean, we cover every feature with unit tests.

# 📦 Installation

1. [Download for Godot 4.x](https://github.com/bitbrain/pandora/archive/refs/heads/godot-4.x.zip)
2. Extract the `pandora` folder into your `/addons` folder within the Godot project.
